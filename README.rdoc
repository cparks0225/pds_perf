Scuttle is a project for generating load tests against restful apis that utilize Swagger(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec).

It allows the specification of several different Systems, and different environments within those systems (dev/test/staging/prod/etc)

Browsing the Swagger API, it is easy to create (or manually add) urls which can then be wrapped into simple tests and suites of tests.

Test Suites run asynchronously and return the Round Trip time in Microseconds for each restful call, and can be downloaded as CSVs.
